                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Android is a Linux based operating system it is designed primarily for touch screens mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. The operating system has developed a lot in the last 15 years starting from black and white phones to recent smartphones or mini computers. One of the most widely used mobile OS   these days is android.  The android is software that was founded in Palo Alto of California in 2003.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">1. Interface</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, 
                        like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard.[79] Game controllers 
                        and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB.[80][81] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides
                         a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such 
                         as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting 
                         the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,[82] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by
                          rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.[83]

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Applications ("apps"), which extend the functionality of devices (and must be 64-bit[91]), are written using the Android software development kit 
                        (SDK)[92] and, often, Kotlin programming language, which replaced Java as Google's preferred language for Android app development in May 2019,[93] 
                        and was originally announced in May 2017.[94][95] Java is still supported (originally the only option for user-space programs, and is often mixed 
                        with Kotlin), as is C++.[96] Java and/or other JVM languages, such as Kotlin, may be combined with C/C++,[97] together with a choice of non-default 
                        runtimes that allow better C++ support.[98] The Go programming language is also supported, although with a limited set of application programming interfaces (API).[99]

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">The android is an operating system and is a stack of software components which is divided into five sections and four main layers that is<br>
